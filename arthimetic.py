# You are given a code with initialization of count. (Don't delete this line!)

# Your task is to add the following operations, in this order:

# Add 4 to count
# Multiply count by 2
# Subtract 1 from count
# Use the arithmetic shortcuts to do so

# You are given a code with initialization of score. (Don't delete this line!)

# Your task is to modify the score variable using arithmetic shortcuts, in this order:

# Divide score by 2
# Add 10 to score
# Multiply score by 3
# Remember to use the arithmetic shortcuts for each operation! result= 180.0
